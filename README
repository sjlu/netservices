This file has been created as a point of reference,

This file will not contain any "secret" information of
the site, but will contain styles of programming, etc.

1. Any CSS that can be used through multiple tags is
is done so through "classes" or "." in CSS/jQuery.
Anything that is different throughout similar "classes"
is modifed through the inline CSS (or directly in the HTML)
directory.

2. Anything that does not need any server-side processing
meaning anything that does not need variable environments
or file systems will be written staticly in HTML/Javascript.
Javascript is handled on the client's browser, giving the
server a lot more resources since processing power for 
the client side is much higher these days. This allows us
to handle more requests per second because we do not
need to wait for server system I/O to process these requests.
Otherwise, all other requests will be processed through PHP.

3. Filesystem structures.
/ - contains all html files which are served by the HTTPd
/resources - contains resources included by HTML pages in parent
/resources/img
/resources/js
/resources/css
